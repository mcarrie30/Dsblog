      <description>Metis My first week as a student Data Scientist at Metis NYC has been challenging but also, incredible! I had high expectations coming in (after reading so many reviews); however, Metis has exceeded my expectations. I have been coding and learning so much that I live, sleep and dream in code now.
Since starting, my routine has been:
6:15 - 8:00 Wake up, Walk Dog, Do some coding
8:00 - 9:00 Take the LIRR to NYC</description>
