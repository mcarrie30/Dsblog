## Metis


My first week as a student Data Scientist at Metis NYC has been challenging but also, incredible! I had high expectations coming in (after reading so many reviews); however, Metis has exceeded my expectations.


Since starting, my routine has been:


6:15 - 8:00 Wake up, Walk Dog, Do some coding

8:00 - 9:00 Take the LIRR to NYC

9:00 - 9:30  Do some code until lectures start

9:30 - 12 Lectures

12:00 - 1:30 Lunch

1:30 - 6:00 Projects and Presentations


One of my weaknesses has always been presenting in front of a group of people. After looking at the Metis curiculum, I feel confident that my weakness will beocme a new strength. I will present my data findings 5 times to my classmates over the next several weeks, and my final project to numerous employers on career day.

Over the last couple days, I have been working on manipulating data into a clean data frame to preform statistical analysis that could help a client determine which was the best subway location to talk and obtain emails from commuters


Coming from an R background, python syntax and .groupby statements has been extremely challenging for me.

Some cool charts that I made in the couple days using Bokeh and Seaborn
